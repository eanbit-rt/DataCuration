# Data Curation Course

Training Resources for H3A Fellows Training

ToDO:
- Create a markdown document for each topic and highlight the learning objectives and outcomes---base this on the ISCB competencies. 
- 
### Topics
**We may need to start with a topic on data organization and management.**

1. Cleaning up and putting together large datasets with R and the tidyverse environment
2. FAIR Data Principles and their implementation in our scientific space 
3. Metadata standards for genomic data and uploading to Genbank/ ENA

### Core competencies
These are the high-level competencies that we focus on imparting during the training. Data management is a newly introduced competency. 
- Current approaches for modelling and warehousing of life science data; 
- The importance of data governance, curation, information architecture and ensuring interoperability
- Common document identification, tracking and control procedures
- FAIR principles
- Ethical, legal and social implications of using/storing sensitive data
- Data protection concepts 
- Knowledge representation (e.g. file formats, ontologies and other controlled vocabularies)

At the end of the training, the trainees should be able to:
- Makes use of suitable programming languages and/or workflow tools to automate data handling and curation tasks
- Curates biological data using suitable metadata, ontologies and/or controlled vocabularies
- Draft and file an appropriate Data Management Plan
- Prepare data for submission to appropriate public bioinformatics data repositories as required, being aware of ethical and legal considerations

## 2. FAIR Data Principles and their implementation in our scientific space
In this lesson, we will be 
 
### Learning Objectives
- Be aware of the FAIR data principles
- Understand how the FAIR Data principles are applicable in genomics
- Know how to develop a data management plan that adheres to FAIR principles
- Understand the limits of FAIRness and Open science, i.e. Know how to protect their data


### Learning Outcomes
- Be able to outline the FAIR principles and how they can be applied
- be able to highlight and apply the FAIR principles in genomics --- or any of their research
- Know the various tools that can be used to develop a data management plan
- Be prepared to apply open science principles but protect their data: Be as open as possible and closed as necessary

## 3. Metadata standards for genomic data and uploading to Genbank/ ENA
